   *This might take a while.*
   *Please refrain from doing anything else on your device in the meantime.*
1. Go into the Google Play Store and disable automatic app updates for YouTube.
1. Reboot

## Concept

In most legislations it is illegal to redistribute modified software 
without consent of the copyright holder.

For example:  
The Windows modding community isn't allowed to distribute modified Windows ISOs
but is allowed to distribute a patcher, 
which the user can download to patch their geniune Windows ISO.

The same concept can be applied to ReVanced.  
Redistributing magisk modules with the patched YouTube APK is not legal.
But we are totally fine distributing the patcher 
and letting the user patch the original APK on his own.

This module automates exactly this.
You, the user, download the original YouTube APK yourself.
This module will patch the installed YouTube APK during installation
**right on your device**.
